# Recommenders

## Course Overview
This repository contains coursework and practical exercises completed for the **Recommender Systems** course, part of the Master of Science in Fundamental Principles of Data Science at Universitat de Barcelona. The course focuses on the principles, algorithms, and implementation of recommendation systems used in modern applications.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the main paradigms of recommender systems, including collaborative filtering, content-based, and hybrid approaches  
- Learn matrix factorization and factorization machine models for personalized recommendations  
- Implement non-personalized recommenders as baselines for comparison  
- Explore neural network-based approaches for recommendation using Keras  
- Gain practical experience in evaluating recommender system performance
